Title: Quarterback Vision Test

I wanted to make this project because I recognize the need for football players, specifically quarterbacks, to have good field vision. Coaches always train their players physically; do more reps, work harder, run faster, etc. But no one ever teaches players how to train mentally. My project will attempt to do that by helping quarterbacks visualize the field and cycle through their receivers until they find the best option.
I was inspired by<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAIGVT3N7B0&t=45s"> this project</a>. I figured if a chimpanzee can visualize a screen well enough to remember nine random boxes in the space of a single second, a human should be able to do the same.
In designed football plays, there is usually a featured receiver that the QB is supposed to look at first in order to check their eligibility. If that player is covered well, they have to be able to recognize that and cycle through the list of their available options. All of this has to be done in a matter of seconds, else they are likely to end up on the ground underneath a 300 pound defensive lineman.
I replicated this in my project by using a series of LEDs that, when prompted, will light up randomly. There are four LEDs of different colors representing four different receivers and one button. At the moment, only one LED lights up when the button is pressed, showing the featured receiver. I created boxes using the Cricut to place over the LEDs, and I have one big box that houses my breadboard and Arduino Uno. The wires to the LEDs run through the main box, where they are glued to the tiny paper boxes I made. I coded this so that each light corresponds to a number, which is selected randomly by the computer. I chose the button because it is easily used as a trigger for the LEDs.
I couldn't figure out how to make the other LEDs turn on following the first one, which would represent the other receiver options. With more time, I could definitely make this project more useful. I'd like to incorporate a motion sensor that would track whether or not the player's head actually moves to look at each individual light. There could also be a better visual system. Instead of using boxes of LEDs, I could use a long breadboard with the lights on it, or even a digital display touchscreen. You could make it more accurate looking in that case to represent the football field, and even include defensive backs that would make it harder to see. It could also be more interactive so that you could touch the screen to pick a receiver.
